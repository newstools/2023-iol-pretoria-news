However, it was flagged as one of the most congested cities in South Africa with an average of 145 hours over a 6-day period spent in rush hour traffic per year. This meant on average, motorists took roughly 16 minutes to traverse 10km at a mere 32km/h speed. Travel time reportedly increased in Pretoria last year, with the data suggesting that the average time it took to travel 10km had in fact increased by 40 seconds from 2021.

Driving through the capital on Tuesdays, between 4pm and 5pm, was also, the index said, the worst time to go through the city as it took even longer at 19 minutes and 40 seconds. Second place went to the City of Cape Town and third place to East London, with motorists spending on average 132 hours over a 5.5-day period in rush hour traffic per year.
