After his return to South Africa in 1995, he was integrated into the SANDF, and later appointed chief of logistics. At the event, held at the Logistics Support Formation sportsground in Lyttelton, men and women of the army divisions paraded and marched under his watchful eye. The outgoing chief went onto the ground to assess the code of conduct for uniformed members, after which the military held a religious observation for him. In his farewell speech, Mbuli thanked his former colleagues for the love and respect shown towards him, and said he would take his retirement as a holiday. To the amusement of those in attendance, he told of the number of times when he would apply for his annual leave and go on holiday, only to be called back by his superiors before it had ended because he was needed at work. He wished his successor well in his new role and gave him a sword to mark the change of command. Pretoria News
