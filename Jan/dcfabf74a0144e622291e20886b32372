Pretoria - The Makane and Sebe families of Pretoria and East London are devastated and deeply anxious, after the murderers of their daughters, Kearabetswe Makane and Sivenathi Sebe. The Makane family said what happened to them was painful and they would not wish it on anyone. On December 18, Kearabetswe, from Mabopane, was murdered and dumped at a graveyard, allegedly by her partner, and it was alleged that this was witnessed by their 3-year-old daughter. “Every time when we wake up we feel like we will hear her voice but she’s no more. We celebrated our festive season in pain, we really hope the law will take its course,” said Loate Makane. Kearabetswe was buried on December 24, and yesterday the family said the pain was still fresh and they were in disbelief, but they hoped the law would give them justice. Police spokesperson Colonel Noxolo Kweza said the suspect made his initial appearance at Ga-Rankuwa magistrate court on December 20. He is currently at Kgosi Mampuru Correctional Services and is due back in court on March 28. The family of 28 year-old Sebe from East London said their pain was still deep as her killer or killers had not been arrested. The body of the student was found next to a railway station in Pretoria West, and when she was buried early in December, her case was still pending and no arrests had been made Following forensic examinations, the police accepted that she had been killed, after initially saying she had fallen asleep and then died overnight. Sebe had gone missing after a night out with friends, who opened a missing person’s case when she did not return to her accommodation. Her family said up until now there had been no developments. Police said they were still investigating leads. Pretoria News
