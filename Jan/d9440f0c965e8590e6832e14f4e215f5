Pretoria - The City of Tshwane is looking forward to reopening its early childhood development (ECD) centres on Monday. MMC for Social Development and Community Services, Peggy de Bruin, said the ECD centres under the municipality were in a good state and ready to welcome the young ones. “This is a major development for the City as most of our ECD centres remained closed for an extended period of time due to lingering negative effects caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns,” De Bruin said. The City’s social development services department manages seven ECD centres located in regions 3 and 6. De Bruin said ECD centres played an important role in a child’s development, providing the foundation for all future learning, behaviour and health. “A strong foundation helps children develop the skills they need to become well-functioning adults. Optimising the early years of a child’s life is the best investment the City and communities can make in ensuring a successful future for our young ones.” She said the City had invested in upgrading its ECD centres over the years. The upgrades include extensive renovations and beefed-up security. Other highlights were the employment of trained and professional teachers and up-to-date learning programmes. De Bruin said: “Taking into consideration the current economic climate faced by our communities, we have ensured that enrolment fees are kept at a minimum at about R300 per month.” Pretoria News
