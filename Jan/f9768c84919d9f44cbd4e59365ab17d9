Pretoria - The future of ANC caucus leader in Tshwane council, France Boshielo, hangs in the balance after the party undertook to introduce its incumbent regional chairperson Eugene “Bonzo” Modise, as a council member. Modise is set to replace former ANC regional chairperson Dr Kgosi Maepa, who recently made known his exit as a PR councillor. Maepa, who was previously a caucus leader and regional party chairperson, was replaced two years ago by Boshielo after the ANC regional executive committee (REC) ousted him in a secret ballot. Boshielo, who is the current deputy ANC regional chairperson, emerged as a preferred mayoral candidate during the first round of the party nomination process ahead of the 2021 municipal elections. Party regional secretary George Matjila said that a move to usher in Modise was aimed at strengthening the ANC caucus in council. Matjila was tight-lipped when asked whether Boshielo would be forced to relinquish his role as caucus leader and make way for Modise. However, he said Modise would have to be given some responsibilities as a regional chairperson. However, the Pretoria News was told by some party members that Modise was destined to lead the party caucus in council. Matjila said: “Remember when Kgosi Maepa was the chair, I was in council, and I had to move out of council to make way for him as the chair of the region. Our position was that the chairperson of the region cannot be outside. “The REC will take a decision on whether Bonzo is coming in as the caucus leader. “But he is the chair of the region, and obviously, the chair in council will have to be given a responsibility, and when it happens, it will be communicated to you.” On Maepa’s exit, he said: “We are still going to depend on him for his wisdom. The possibility is that the chairperson of the region is going to be put into council … because we can’t have a person elected in council in the position of chairpersonship outside council and not guiding council.” Pretoria News
