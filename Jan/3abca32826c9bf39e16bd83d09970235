Mpumalanga provincial police spokesperson Colonel Donald Mdhluli said the two charred bodies were found on Monday. “It was an astonishment and horrific experience at the discovery of two burnt bodies in a dumping site in Casteel outside Acornhoek near Bushbuckridge on Monday, at about 7:30,” he said. “Police were alerted by a community member about the gruesome discovery, and upon arrival at the scene, medical practitioners were summoned who certified both male victims dead.” Alongside the deceased, police found three carcasses of cattle. “The police are in a process of finding their families so that the two could be identified. “The motive behind the killing is unknown at the moment pending investigations.
