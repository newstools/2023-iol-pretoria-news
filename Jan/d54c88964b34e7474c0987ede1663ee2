Pretoria - An unexpected electrical fault on the pumps that supply the Zwartkop area in Centurion caused a serious water shortage in the area from Monday night and into yesterday morning. The fault caused low water pressure that saw many residents appealing to their ward councillor and MMC for Finance Peter Sutton for a remedy. Sutton said water levels dropped to as low as 45%; the City had warned residents about possible outages that could result in water supply issues. “This was not a result of load shedding, because the area actually does not get load shedding because of some problems with the power station,” Sutton said. “Outage was caused by an electric fault on the pumps. The fault was resolved by an electrician. This was a water problem, but I ended up needing an electrician.” Tshwane, in obeying Rand Water’s directive, cautioned residents to use water sparingly, informing them about possible shortages that could result from the high temperatures which affect water levels at the reservoirs of the bulk water supplier. The warnings about possible water shortages were not unique to Tshwane, but other parts of Gauteng and the country as well. It has been a hot few days, coupled with serious stages of load shedding, which cause damage to and faults on the water supply infrastructure. By midday yesterday, water in the suburb was restored, but the City warned all residents to keep in mind that occasional shortages would be the norm, as load shedding and high temperatures persisted.
