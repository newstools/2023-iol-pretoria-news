Pretoria - The former mayor of Mkhondo Local Municipality, Vusi Motha, has been arrested in connection with possession of an unlicensed firearm, which police hope to link to the murder of Councillor Sibonelo Ntshangase and his two comrades, Sandile Khumalo and Sizwe Mbingo. Provincial police spokesperson Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said Motha was arrested along with Willington Sangweni late on Monday, following the establishment of a national task team to deal with the murders that took place at Longhomes Township in Piet Retief at the weekend. Motha faces charges of possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition while Sangweni faces charges of fraud, contravention of the Firearms Control Act, and the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority Act. “The team worked tirelessly until they made a breakthrough after receiving information on the whereabouts of the two suspects who were arrested on Monday. “During the arrest, an automatic rifle with ammunition was confiscated. They are both charged with possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. “Police also confiscated other firearms and ammunition alleged to be owned by a certain security company. An investigation is under way to determine the lawful owners. “Police will test the seized firearm and ammunition to determine whether they were used previously in the commission of a crime. The two could also possibly face other charges, including the fatal shooting of the three victims,” said Mohlala. Motha and Sangweni appeared in the Piet Retief Magistrate’s Court and were remanded in custody until January 24, when they will apply for bail. Pretoria News
