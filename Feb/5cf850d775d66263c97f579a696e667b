Pretoria - With the world going digital, pupils at Matseke Primary School in Atteridgeville got an opportunity to see robotics, learn more about coding and other advanced learning tactics to prepare them for the future. Friday’s event was the brainchild of the Dr Gwen Ramokgopa Foundation, attended by the National Youth Development Agency, Department of Education and Unilever. Pupils were inspired by the initiative and given an opportunity to fly drones (with the hope) that one day they will become inventors of many more robotics. Ramokgopa, the ANC treasurer-general, stressed the importance of the development of pupils. If their special their talents were nurtured correctly they would change the world, she said. The fourth industrial revolution had arrived; therefore the education system had to change to equip the children with the skills needed to survive, she said. The foundation initiated a programme last year, named adopt-a-class, to improve the infrastructure of the school. The programme helped the school to renovate many classrooms as each and everyone got an opportunity to pick one classroom and decorate it to accommodate learners and give them a place to dream. “Our foundation commits to raising children as stars to reach great heights, stars are inspiring, they give hope and they shine when it’s dark. The same goes for pupils. They are the hope for the future to change the world.” Ramokgopa added: “We need to make our education system future-ready and future-proof and this is why we need to invest in robotics, in artificial intelligence and in maths to resolve problems in a systematic manner.” Pretoria News
