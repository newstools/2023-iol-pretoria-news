Pretoria - The public has been urged to remain extra cautious in low lying areas as more rain's been predicted. Spokesperson for Tshwane Emergency Services Department and deputy chief Charles Mabaso said there were no fatalities or serious injuries from the rains, but they had to assist families to channel water away from their homes. This included residents in informal settlements in Mamelodi, Nellmapius and Soshanguve, while roads over low-lying bridges in some areas had to be closed because of floods. “We also experienced traffic congestions in the afternoons of heavy rain, due to the weather. A number of trees fell, probably due to lightning. “We will keep monitoring weather patterns as well as the warnings by the SA Weather Service. If need be, we will then warn communities based on the early warnings we receive,” he said. According to the SA Weather Service, today is the only day with no possibility of rain; and tomorrow is the only day which is expected to have clear skies. Chances of rain stand at 60% from Wednesday to Friday. But the rainy weather has been welcomed by residents after the heatwave, which also affected the availability of water in the city and parts of Gauteng. Bulk water supplier Rand Water said the heatwave was among the reasons preventing them from supplying sufficient water to municipalities. Mabaso said a wall collapsed between Femina Hospital and Princehof due to flash flooding on Thursday. Motorists were urged to be careful on the roads, including the one that crossed the Apies River going towards Capitol Park, that was flooded during the week.  Pretoria News
